    <h3>Kyoto, Japan</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Considered the heart of traditional Japanese culture, Kyoto is surrounded by shrines, and some of these shrines were created as far back as the 600's. Not only that, but long before Tokyo was established as the capital of Japan, Kyoto had been the first capital for thousands of years (literally) before Tokyo was established as the new capital of Japan and so because of it the culutral heritage surrounding the area of Kyoto is very deep and rich with history. Furthermore, alot of the old emperors of yore within Japan used to rule from within Kyoto.

  <p>
    The Capital city of the U.S.A. it is home to many national monuments that were built there such as the Library of Congress, the Pentagon, The Lincoln Memorial, the Washington monument, as well as the White House. And it home to many other attractions as well that are available to see, such as an International Spy Museum. There are also other attractions that are much more grim but serve as a good reminder for us, for the soldiers who lost their lives in past wars. For instance the Tomb of the Unknown soldier is a main attraction within the D.C. area.

  <h3>Yakutsk, Russia (Coldest City in the world)</h3>
  <p>
    Yakutsk Russia is one of the coldest cities in the world during the winter time, with temperatures regularly dropping to below -50°C in the middle of the winter, and its insane to think about but during the summer the city manages to warm back up again to around a nice comfortable 25-29°C weather. It's currently home to around three hundred thousand residents and the entire megacity is bult on permafrost which is really cool to think about.
